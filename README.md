# CS486---A4

Please compile id3_algo.cpp with gcc (g++ id3_algo.cpp) and then run the output program (./a.out). The program will ask you specify an 
input file which it will read the training data from. The input file should be an csv file like the one provided (set_a.csv). That being 
said, the provided set_a.csv can be used to construct the decision tree. Please neter N when asked for the input file if want to use the
provided set_a.csv file. A detailed investigation of the decision tree constructed using set_a.csv is in assign4.pdf. Please also see 
CS486 A4.pdf for detail of what the program is doing.
